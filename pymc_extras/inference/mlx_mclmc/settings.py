class AdaptationSettings(NamedTuple):
    r"""
    Everything :func:`warmup` adapts, and how.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mass_matrix : str
        ``"variance"`` for blackjax's per-coordinate posterior variance, ``"gradient"`` for
        nuts-rs's :math:`\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[x] / \mathrm{Var}[\nabla \log p]}`, or
        ``"low_rank"`` to fit a low-rank correction on top of the latter. Only ``"low_rank"`` can
        precondition a posterior whose ridges are not axis-aligned.
    diagonal_preconditioning : bool
        Whether to install the estimated metric at all.
    early_switch_freq, switch_freq : int
        Moment-estimator window lengths, before and after ``early_end``.
    early_end : int
        Phase-2 step at which the short early windows give way to the growing ones. 0 disables the
        early phase.
    window_growth : float
        Factor by which each main-phase window exceeds the last.
    low_rank_window : int
        Trailing phase-2 draws retained for a ``"low_rank"`` fit.
    low_rank_refits : int
        Refits within phase 2 before the final one. The first is always the gradient diagonal,
        which seeds the later low-rank fits with draws taken under something better than identity.
    desired_energy_var : float
        Target energy variance per dimension for the step-size controller.
    trust_in_estimate : float
        Width of the controller's Gaussian weighting. Larger values give more weight to single-step
        estimates far from the target.
    num_effective_samples : float
        Sets the controller's exponential decay rate.
    frac_tune1, frac_tune2, frac_tune3 : float
        Fractions of the step budget given to each adaptation phase.
    l_factor : float
        Multiplier on the autocorrelation-derived ``L`` in phase 3.
    optimize_steps : int
        Maximum Adam steps taken toward the mode before adaptation. Off by default. Turn it on
        for a concentrated unimodal posterior far from the initial point. Leave it off for a
        log-density unbounded above, such as a centered hierarchical model, where the ascent
        runs into the funnel and the adaptation follows it there.
    optimize_learning_rate : float
        Adam learning rate for that ascent.
    initial_jitter : float
        Half-width of the uniform scatter of the adapting chains around the initial point, in the
        unconstrained space. 0 starts every chain at the initial point; 1 is pymc's scatter, which
        displaces a tall model too far for the tuning budget to recover from.
