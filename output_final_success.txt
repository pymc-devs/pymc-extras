  warnings.warn(f"Pathfinder failed ({exc}); falling back to NUTS sampling.")
Initializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...
Multiprocess sampling (2 chains in 2 jobs)
NUTS: [intercept_maxdiff, α_unit_maxdiff, α_nationality_maxdiff, α_gender_maxdiff, α_age_group_maxdiff, α_education_maxdiff]
Sampling 2 chains for 200 tune and 200 draw iterations (400 + 400 draws total) took 303 seconds.
We recommend running at least 4 chains for robust computation of convergence diagnostics
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.01 for some parameters. This indicates problems during sampling. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
The effective sample size per chain is smaller than 100 for some parameters.  A higher number is needed for reliable rhat and ess computation. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
Pathfinder inference finished.
